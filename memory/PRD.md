# Grace Cares — Product Requirements & Build Log

## Original problem statement
Replace the WordPress site for Grace Cares (Lichfield CIC, "making care sustainable") with a new
website + ecommerce platform: shop pre-loved care equipment with correct line-level VAT and VAT-relief
declarations, Stripe payments, Xero accounting feed, equipment/financial donations, events & bookings,
care-provider resources, support enquiry routing, news/impact content, customer accounts, and a
role-based non-technical admin area. WCAG 2.2 AA, UK GDPR, security.

## User choices (this build)
- Scope: everything in one phase (broad MVP).
- Auth: JWT email/password with role-based admin.
- Xero: data model + admin sync queue built, **sync MOCKED** (real OAuth/mappings later).
- Email marketing: consent + subscribers stored in-app now, provider later.
- Brand: crawled grace-cares.com; fresh accessible design (Forest Green #144D36 + Terracotta #C85A40,
  Atkinson Hyperlegible + Outfit fonts).

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI (modular: core.py, auth.py, shop.py, content.py, admin.py, seed_data.py), MongoDB (motor).
- Frontend: React 19 + react-router 7, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, sonner, lucide-react. Contexts: Auth, Cart (localStorage).
- Payments: Stripe claimable sandbox (GB), server-computed totals (custom VAT), webhook /api/stripe/webhook + status polling.

## Personas
Individuals/families buying equipment; equipment donors; people claiming VAT relief; caregivers;
older people; NHS & care providers; care managers (ESG); volunteers; corporate partners; funders; event bookers.

## Implemented (2026-06)
- Auth: register/login/logout/me/refresh/forgot/reset, bcrypt, JWT httpOnly cookies, brute-force lockout,
  7 admin roles + customer, sensitive-role gating, super_admin seeded (paul@cass-online.co.uk).
- Shop: categories + 12 seeded products; search/filter/sort; product detail (specs, safety, carbon, related);
  VAT-relief price shown ONLY on eligible products.
- VAT engine: line-level; relief applied only when product eligible AND declaration valid; mixed baskets split;
  delivery standard-rated; verified across 5 scenarios.
- Checkout: guest/account, billing, collection/delivery, VAT-relief declaration capture, optional donation,
  separate unticked marketing consent, T&C acceptance, Stripe redirect, order + reservation created.
- Stock control: reserve on checkout, decrement on payment, 30-min reservation release, oversell => 409,
  stock movements, refund returns stock, wishlist/item requests.
- Donations (one-off + monthly Stripe). Equipment donation form (statuses, admin review). 
- Events: free/paid booking, capacity, waiting list, private online_link hidden from public API.
- Resources: gated/free downloads, consent-gated marketing, download tracking.
- Enquiries: routing by type + sensitive flagging + restricted admin visibility.
- News/Impact articles, homepage content, impact stats (editable), partners, testimonials, newsletter.
- Customer account: orders, bookings, preferences, deletion request, addresses.
- Admin: dashboard reports (+CSV export), products CRUD, orders + refunds, VAT declarations (restricted),
  equipment donations, events + bookings, Xero sync queue + reconciliation (MOCKED), enquiries, donations,
  users & roles, audit logging.

## Testing
- iteration_1.json: backend 38/38 passed; all critical frontend flows pass; no critical/minor bugs.

## Backlog (P1/P2 — not yet built)
- P1: Real Xero OAuth + approved account-code mappings; email provider integration; photo upload (object
  storage) for equipment donations & products; admin MFA; SEO (sitemaps, 301 redirects, structured data);
  WordPress content migration.
- P2: Gift Aid (pending legal confirmation), equipment hire flow, PDF VAT-receipt/declaration export,
  scheduled reminder emails, cookie-consent banner, full a11y screen-reader audit.

## v3 alignment (path B — React+FastAPI, not SSR)
- Confirmed with user: stay on supported CRA+FastAPI stack; true Next.js SSR is a platform limitation (they may contact support@emergent.sh later).
- Applied: v3 brand (#006738 primary, #85E845 accent used only for Donate, 18px base type); v3 10-category set (Bathing, Beds, Fall Prevention, Furniture, Kitchen & Catering, Mobility, Moving & Handling, Toilet Aids, Special Offers, Seating); exact condition-grade wording; unique/repeat stock_model field; "This item has found a new home" sold state; editable announcement bar; grey "REAL PHOTO TO REPLACE" placeholders (no stock photos of people, per v3); v3 hero messaging + mission line; Product JSON-LD (client-side) + Organization JSON-LD in index.html; returns/Incontinence policy wording drafted for legal sign-off.
- Deliverable: 3 homepage visual directions PDF at /frontend/public/grace-cares-visual-directions.pdf (Direction 1 built).
- Deferred (documented, not done): money-as-integer-pence refactor; true SSR/server-rendered HTML; separate Stock table; one-Contact-with-roles CRM; 3 fulfilment routes (postable/hub/bulky questionnaire); Grace AI; partner portals; Google Merchant/Meta feeds; sitemap.xml/robots.txt; admin draft→approve gate; guided one-question volunteer product form.

## v3 round 2 (this session)
- Built: **3 fulfilment routes** (postable / Lichfield hub collection / bulky delivery with an access questionnaire captured on the order); **draft→approve** workflow (product_contributor drafts, product_approver/shop_admin publish; drafts hidden from public shop + sitemap); **guided one-question-at-a-time listing form** with localStorage autosave (saves as draft for approval); **Grace AI** stub assistant (rule-based, refuses clinical/suitability + VAT-eligibility questions and offers a human with call button); **sitemap.xml + robots.txt** (backend) + **301 redirect manager** (admin CRUD + automatic resolution on 404 via NotFound page).
- Verified via API: draft hidden from public list, products-review lists drafts, redirect resolve works, Grace AI refuses with handoff.

## v3 round 3 (this session)
- **Postage bands**: products have `weight_kg`; postable orders are charged by total weight against editable bands (Admin → Postage & Shipping). Verified: 2.5 kg → £7.95 (+VAT).
- **Approval notifications**: creating a draft/awaiting listing writes an in-app notification + a **MOCKED** email log to approvers; Dashboard shows a notifications banner. (Real email = wire provider later.)
- **Bulky delivery quotes**: Admin → Orders "Set delivery quote" on bulky orders creates a Stripe payment link; paying it marks `delivery_quote.status=paid` (webhook + status handled).
- **Redirect CSV import**: Admin → Redirects & SEO bulk-imports `old,new[,code]` CSV (upsert). Verified: imported 2.

## v3 round 4 (this session)
- **Excel + CSV upload**: `/api/admin/products/import-file` accepts `.xlsx`/`.csv` (openpyxl) with a `dry_run` flag.
- **Import preview**: dry-run returns created/updated/error lists and writes nothing; Admin shows a preview then "Apply".
- **Bulk photo import**: `/api/admin/products/import-photos` accepts a `.zip`, matches images to products by SKU (full stem or prefix), stored as base64 data URLs (deploy-safe, no pod-local files).
- **Scheduled weekly export**: `.emergent/crons.yml` → Monday 08:00 UTC POST `/api/cron/weekly-product-export` (Bearer `WEBHOOK_CRON_SECRET`), builds the product+stock CSV and MOCK-emails admins; logged to `export_runs`. Verified: 401 without token, 200 with, dry-run writes nothing, xlsx round-trip creates/updates by SKU.

## v3 round 5 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Object Storage for photos**: integrated Emergent Object Storage (`/app/backend/storage.py`). Bulk zip photo import (`/api/admin/products/import-photos`) and a NEW single-photo upload on the product edit form (`/api/admin/products/upload-image`) now push image bytes to the bucket and store a served URL (`/api/files/{path}`) instead of base64 — ends MongoDB document bloat. Images served via public passthrough endpoint with long cache headers. Verified: upload returns URL, served file is image/png.
- **Product export filters**: `/api/admin/products-export.csv` accepts `category` (slug or id), `stock_status` (in_stock/low_stock/out_of_stock), `date_from`, `date_to`. Admin → Products has an "Export CSV" filter panel. Verified: category=mobility → 4 rows, date_to=2020 → header only, stock filters apply.

## v3 round 6 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Editable VAT declaration wording**: admin can edit the exact checkout declaration statement (heading, intro, guidance bullets, three purpose choices, both confirmation lines) via Admin → VAT Declarations → "Edit the VAT declaration wording". Stored in `site_settings` key `vat_declaration`; served publicly at `GET /api/vat-declaration-statement`; checkout reads it live with code defaults as fallback. Endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/admin/vat-declaration-statement` (finance_admin/content_admin/super_admin).
- **VAT declarations report + export**: Admin → VAT Declarations now has date presets (All time, This month, Last month, This calendar year, Last calendar year, Custom) that filter an on-screen table and a CSV download. Endpoints: `GET /api/admin/vat-declarations?date_from&date_to` and `GET /api/admin/vat-declarations-export.csv?date_from&date_to` (finance_admin). Verified: 2020 range → 0, current year → 2, CSV downloads with all declaration columns.

## v3 round 7 (this session — 2026-06)
- **VAT declaration PDF receipts + email**: `/app/backend/receipts.py` generates a branded PDF per declaration (order ref, date, eligible person, condition, signature, itemised VAT-relieved lines, totals, and the declaration wording). Admin → VAT Declarations rows now have **PDF** (authenticated download/print, `GET /api/admin/vat-declarations/{id}/receipt.pdf`) and **Email** (`POST /api/admin/vat-declarations/{id}/email-receipt`) actions. Email uses Emergent-managed **Resend** — sends the customer (on-file email only, per guardrail G4) an inline receipt summary plus a first-party tokenised secure PDF link (`GET /api/vat-declarations/{id}/receipt.pdf?token=`, bad token → 403). "Sent {date}" shown after emailing. Verified: PDF 200 (3.2KB), tokenised link 200, bad token 403, email send returned an email_id.

## v3 round 8 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Order detail view**: Admin → Orders rows are now clickable (plus a "View" button) opening a detail modal showing status/payment/Xero, customer contact + address, fulfilment + delivery questionnaire, VAT-relief flag, itemised line table (with per-line relief marker), totals breakdown, delivery quote, and refund history. Added inline **status update** dropdown (uses existing `PUT /api/admin/orders/{id}/status`). Refund + delivery-quote actions available from the modal. Frontend-only; no backend change (list endpoint already returns full docs). Verified via screenshot.

## v3 round 9 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Order search & filter**: Admin → Orders has a live search box (reference / customer name / email) and a status dropdown; shows "X of Y orders". Client-side over the loaded list.
- **Order activity timeline**: order detail modal now shows a dated trail — placed (`created_at`), payment received (`paid_at`), each status change, delivery quote set/paid, and refunds. `PUT /api/admin/orders/{id}/status` now appends `{status, at, by, note}` to a `status_history` array on the order.
- **Relief totals in declarations report**: `/admin/vat-declarations` list and `vat-declarations-export.csv` now include `order_total_paid` and `total_vat_relieved` (VAT that would have applied to relieved lines = 20% × ex-VAT). Verified £5.60 on a £28 order.
- **Clickable declaration from an order**: if an order claimed relief, the modal shows "view declaration" which opens a popup layered over the order (`GET /api/admin/vat-declarations/{id}`) with the full declaration, relieved-item breakdown, and total relieved.

## v3 round 11 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Products & available-stock report (Excel + PDF)**: Admin → Products export panel now offers **Excel report** (`/admin/products-stock-report.xlsx`) and **PDF report** (`/admin/products-stock-report.pdf`) alongside CSV. All three honour the same category / stock-status / date filters. Columns: SKU, Name, Category, Condition, Status, Price ex VAT, VAT relief, Qty in stock, Reserved, Available now — with a totals row (product count + total available). Excel is styled (green frozen header, column widths); PDF is branded landscape. Shared `_query_products` helper in extra.py. Verified: xlsx 16 products/43 available, category filter → 4 mobility, PDF valid.

## v3 round 10 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Order confirmation emails (Resend)**: sent automatically to the customer on payment (in `finalize_paid_order`); resendable from the order detail view (`POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/send-confirmation`).
- **Dispatch / collection emails**: marking an order `dispatched` or `ready_for_collection` auto-emails the customer; any other status can optionally email via a "notify customer" checkbox (`notify` flag on `PUT /admin/orders/{id}/status`).
- **Timeline notes**: staff add free-text internal notes to an order (`POST /admin/orders/{id}/note`, `kind:"note"` in `status_history`), rendered in the activity timeline; status entries show a "customer emailed" marker.
- **Saved report views**: finance can save a favourite declarations date range (`GET/PUT /admin/vat-report-view`) so the report opens ready. Shared email module `emails.py` (gate + send_email + templates); receipts.py now imports it.

## v3 round 12 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Interactive dashboard**: date-range selector (defaults to **This month**, plus Last month, This/Last calendar year, All time, Custom dates) drives all tiles via `GET /admin/reports/summary?date_from&date_to`. Every tile is now **clickable** and opens a drill-down modal listing the records behind it via `GET /admin/reports/details?metric=&date_from&date_to` — money tiles → paid orders (date, ref, customer, ex-VAT, VAT, total), plus donations, refunds, zero-rated, items reused (order lines), event bookings, resource downloads (`at` field), email signups, and low stock. Range-aware metrics (orders, VAT, donations, items reused/carbon from paid-order lines in range); low stock is current-state. Verified: this-month filter, details endpoints (low stock → 6 rows), generic table renders.

## v3 round 13 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Period comparison on dashboard tiles**: `/admin/reports/summary` now also computes the equal-length previous period (when a date range is set) and returns `previous` + `previous_period`. Each tile shows a ▲/▼ % change vs the previous period (green up / terracotta down, "▲ new" when prior was zero, "no change" when both zero); omitted for "all time". Verified: Sep → prev Aug 2–31, all-time omits comparison, tiles render deltas (bookings/downloads/signups showed ▼100%).

## v3 round 14 (this session — 2026-06)
- **"Add to stock" from equipment donations**: each donation submission (Admin → Equipment Donations) now has an **Add to stock** button that opens a new-product window pre-filled from the donation (name ← equipment type, SKU ← donation ref, condition mapped to grade, description ← notes). Admin completes the required fields (price, category, quantity, weight, fulfilment route, VAT relief) and saves; product is created as a **draft** via `POST /products` (goes through the existing approval/publish workflow) and the donation is auto-advanced to `received`. Verified end-to-end: draft "Wheelchair" (ED-14193004, £45) created and listed in Products with Publish action.

## v3 round 15 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Auto category-based SKU**: `GET /admin/next-sku?category_id=` returns the next tidy SKU continuing the category's existing sequence (e.g. Mobility → MOB-005). In the Add-to-stock modal, picking a category auto-fills the SKU (editable).
- **Publish shortcut**: Add-to-stock modal offers "Save as draft" and (for super_admin/shop_admin/product_approver) "Save & publish" (creates product with status `available`).
- **Photo carry-over**: donation `photos` prefill the new product's Image URLs field.
- **Link-back**: on save, the donation stores `listed_product_id`/`listed_product_sku` (extended `EDUpdateBody`), advances to `received`, and the card shows a "Listed as product <sku> →" link to the storefront; the Add-to-stock button then disappears.
- **Financial Donations page**: rows are clickable → detail modal; date-range presets (default All time) + custom dates filter the list (`/admin/donations?date_from&date_to`); CSV/Excel/PDF reports (`/admin/donations-export.csv`, `/admin/donations-report.xlsx`, `/admin/donations-report.pdf`) honour the range, styled/branded with totals.
- **Clickable notification banner**: each dashboard notification is a button that marks itself read and navigates to the relevant section (new listing → Products, order/refund → Orders, donation → Donations, booking → Events, enquiry → Enquiries).
- Tested by testing_agent (frontend) — 100%, no issues (iteration_2.json).

## v3 round 17 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Editable email templates back-office**: new Admin → Email Templates section. All four transactional emails (order confirmation, order status update, donation thank-you, VAT relief receipt) are editable — subject + inner HTML body with `{{variables}}` (structural fragments like items table, receipt box, buttons are injected as variables so branding/guardrails stay intact). Live Preview renders with sample data; Save/Reset-to-default; each save is validated by the email guardrail gate (rejects forms, credential asks, unsafe links — e.g. a `<form>` body returns 400). Endpoints: `GET /admin/email-templates`, `PUT/POST .../{key}`, `POST .../{key}/preview`, `POST .../{key}/reset`. Overrides stored in `email_templates` collection; `emails.py` refactored to a `TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS` registry + `render_and_send`; `receipts.py` VAT email now uses the `vat_receipt` template.
- **Donation thank-you email**: sent automatically to donors when a donation payment succeeds (in `_finalize_donation`), resendable from the donation detail modal (`POST /admin/donations/{id}/thank-you`), with a "Thank-you sent" indicator. Note: Resend blocks obviously-fake recipient addresses (seed donors) with a clear "recipient undeliverable" message; real addresses deliver.

## v3 round 18 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Rich text email editor + test send**: the email-template body editor is now a rich text editor (bold/italic/underline, H2, paragraph, bullet list, link) with a `</> HTML` toggle for raw editing, and a **"Send test to me"** button that emails the rendered template (with sample data) to the logged-in admin (`POST /admin/email-templates/{key}/test-send`).
- **Booking confirmation email**: new editable `booking_confirmation` template; sent automatically when an event booking is confirmed — free events immediately, paid events after payment (`_finalize_event_booking`).
- **Enquiry auto-reply**: new editable `enquiry_auto_reply` template; a friendly acknowledgement sent automatically when someone submits an enquiry (`POST /enquiries`). Verified: Resend returned 202 Accepted for a deliverable test address.

## v3 round 19 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Collapsible "Admin" sidebar group**: moved Users & Roles, Xero Sync, Email Templates, and Redirects & SEO out of the flat nav into a new collapsible "Admin" group (gear icon + chevron) at the bottom of the sidebar. It auto-expands when one of its items is the active section. Main operational sections (Dashboard, Products, Orders, VAT, Equipment, Events, Guided Listing, Postage, Enquiries, Financial Donations) remain top-level.

## v3 round 20 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Role-gated admin navigation**: the sidebar now honours the Users & Roles matrix. A `SECTION_ROLES` map mirrors the backend `require_admin()` roles for every section; `canAccess()` filters both the main nav and the collapsible Admin group (super_admin always sees all). The Admin group is hidden entirely when a role can't access any of its items; the active section falls back to the first the user can access, and the content area shows a "No access" message if an out-of-scope section is reached. Verified: a finance_admin sees only Dashboard/Orders/VAT/Postage/Enquiries/Donations + an Admin group with just Xero Sync; Users/Email Templates/Redirects and Products/Equipment/Events/Guided are hidden.

## v3 round 21 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Editable section permissions**: a super admin can now set which roles see which sections from Users & Roles (a "Section access by role" checkbox matrix). Stored in `site_settings.section_permissions`; the sidebar `canAccess()` loads it live (`GET/PUT /admin/section-permissions`, PUT is super_admin-only), falling back to code defaults. Users & Roles stays super-admin-only. Verified: GET returns 14 sections, PUT saves/reset, matrix renders.
- **Event booking reminders**: new editable `booking_reminder` email template; a daily cron (`/api/cron/booking-reminders`, 9am UTC in `.emergent/crons.yml`, bearer-secret auth, background task) emails everyone with a confirmed booking for an event starting the next day, marking `reminder_sent` to avoid duplicates. Verified: cron 200 with auth / 401 without; template present (7 total).

## v3 round 22 (this session — 2026-06)
- **Per-event reminder timing**: each event now chooses how far ahead its booking reminder is sent (1/2/3/5/7/14 days) via a "Reminder email timing" dropdown in the Admin → Events form (`reminder_days_before`, default 1). Backend cron `_send_booking_reminders` fires when `start_at.date() − today == reminder_days_before` (falls back to 1 for events without the field). Verified end-to-end: PUT persisted `reminder_days_before=3`; UI dropdown renders and binds.

## Deferred (still open)
- Confirm VAT declaration wording + product classifications with Grace Cares' VAT adviser.
- Provide Xero credentials + approved mappings to switch sync from mocked to live.

## Overnight Build Log — Phases against gap analysis (plan/plan.md). Architecture kept as React SPA + FastAPI (no Next.js, per user).

### Phase 1 — Search & Findability (brief Prompt 2) ✅ (backend tested 19/19, frontend verified)
- Synonym + misspelling tolerance and multi-word matching in GET /api/products (backend/shop.py); admin-editable synonyms.
- Type-ahead suggestions: GET /api/search/suggest (backend/search.py); header dropdown (Layout.jsx).
- New sorts: "Biggest saving" (rrp − price) and "Biggest carbon saving"; RRP backfilled on startup; saving badges on ProductCard.
- Search logging + monthly report (GET /api/admin/search-report); stock-alert capture (POST /api/stock-alerts) + admin list.
- Zero-results experience: category buttons + fallback products + stock-alert form (ZeroResults.jsx).

### Phase 2 — Checkout donation options (brief Prompt 4) ✅ (math verified via API + UI)
- Round-up to nearest pound and "cover the card fee" toggles at checkout (backend/shop.py compute_order; Checkout.jsx). Totals expose donation_explicit, donation_roundup, card_fee_contribution.

### Phase 3 — Missing content/trust pages (brief Prompt 7) ✅ (verified)
- New pages + routes + footer/nav links: /faqs, /sustainability, /returns, /accessibility, /cookies (StaticPages.jsx, App.js, Layout.jsx).

### Blocked — needs user input in the morning
- External keys/accounts: Google Merchant + Meta feeds, live Xero, Google/Facebook reviews wall, Analytics/Search Console, postcode lookup (Loqate/getAddress), SMS (Twilio), email DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC).
- Decision required (risky retrofit on working checkout): integer-pence money, separate atomic StockItem table w/ serial numbers, Location dimension.
